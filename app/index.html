          <h3>What's all this?</h3>
          <p>
            If you need some human spritesheets but don't have
            the time or artistic skill you've come to the right place.
            I occasionally try to make a game and, as someone who works
            as a programmer, one of my biggest struggles is putting together
            graphics of any quality. This recipe attempts to bridge that
            gap by applying motion capture data to generated 3d human models
            and rendering the resultant animation to spritesheets with
            freely available tools.

          <h3>The Body</h3>
          <p>
            First, we need a 3d model of the character.
            We'll be generating one with <a href="http://www.makehuman.org/">MakeHuman</a> which lets you manipulate a bunch of 
            parameters to generate unique models.
          </p>
          <p>
            Installation seems real easy:
            <a href="http://www.makehuman.org/content/download.html">
              download it here.
            </a>
          </p>
          <h4>
            Make a character
          </h4>
          <p>
            Drag around the sliders until you're happy with the result.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nice. Maybe you're not so bad at art after all.
          </p>
          <h4>Export it for Blender</h4>
          <p>
            When you're done with your character it's time to export it
            for use in Blender. Go to Files > Export tab and select
            "Blender exchange (mhx)" as the mesh format.
            Name it and export it.
          </p>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <h3>Import the model into Blender</h3>
          <p>
            Blender is also simple to install and can be 
            <a href="http://www.blender.org/download/">downloaded here.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            We also need to install some addons for Blender.
            Follow these steps, depending on your platform:
            <a href="http://www.makehuman.org/doc/node/mhblendertools_download_and_installation.html">
              installing MakeHuman blender tools.
            </a> You'll only need to install "mhx_importer" and "MakeWalk".
            It's basically just copying some files to the right place
            and then enabling them in the File > User Preferences menu
            of Blender.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now "MakeHuman mhx" should be available as an import option in
            Blender.
            Import the character you exported from MakeHuman.

          <h3>Pick your motion</h3>
          <p>
            The <a href="http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/">CMU Motion Capture Database</a>
            has a bunch of common motions available. You can get a preview of the
            motion by downloading the "Animated" version.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, we actually need this data in the BVH format which is not
            available on the CMU site. <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/cgspeed.com/cgspeed/motion-capture/daz-friendly-release">This page</a> contains
            bundles of the CMU data converted to BVH. The directories are named
            after the CMU subject number and trial number. So subject #2 trial #1
            ("walk") is in directory 02.

          <h3>Combine the motion and model</h3>
          <p>
            Back in Blender, make sure you are in pose mode with your
            character selected. The MakeWalk panels can be found in
            the tool shelf on the left under the "Misc" tab.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="images/blender-makewalkui.png">
          </p>
          <p>
            Click "Load and Retarget" and choose the BVH file you'd like
            to use. We're continuing with subject #2 trial #1.
          </p>

            If all went well, the motion will have been applied to the
            model. Use the playback controls to check it out. In all
            likelyhood, the animation is probably a little messed up.
            There are ways to clean all this stuff up but that's outside
            the scope of this article.

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <h3>Render the animation</h3>
          <p>
            In order to render the animation we set up a camera
            and edit the animation so the model doesn't actually
            move around, keeping it in the view of the camera.
          </p>
          <h4>Fix the model in place</h4>
          <p>
            Make sure you're on the first frame.
            Open up the "MakeWalk: Edit Actions" panel and choose "Global Edit".
            From the "Pose > Clear Transforms" menu choose "Location" to move the
            model to the origin. Then, back in MakeWalk, click "Fixate Bone Location" then "Shift Animation." This should leave you on the last
            frame of the animation, with the whole thing shifted so the
            character never moves from the origin.
          </p>
          <h4>Set up the camera</h4>
          <p>
            The most important camera property to be set is the 
            alpha shading which should be set to "transparent" so
            we can cleanly overlay the sprites on stuff. Here I'm
            using an orthographic projection to make the camera
            set up easier since we don't really need much depth
            here anyways.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="images/blender-orthocamera.png">
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also tweaked the lighting and rendering properties a little.
            Turned on ambient occlusion with multiply, and environmental lighting
            "white". I've chosen to render the first 25 frames in the
            camera frame range options. Choose "Render > Render animation"
            and wait.

          <h3>Make the spritesheet</h3>
          <p>
            At this point you'll have a bunch of numbered images, each
            a frame of the animation

            This is probably way higher resolution
            than you'll actually use. You can mess with
            the render output size in Blender or just
            resize them in the next step.

          <h4>Our final tool: aseprite</h4>
          <p>
            I've been using the free v0.9.5 available <a href="http://www.aseprite.org/older-versions/">here</a> but just noticed there is
            now a <a href="http://www.aseprite.org/download/">paid v1.0</a> which is probably very nice.
          </p>
          <p>
            From "File > Open" choose the first image of your rendered animation.
            Aseprite should recognize it's a sequence and prompt you to import
            all the frames; choose yes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's probably best to "Sprite > Trim" your sequence to remove
            extra empty space. You might also want to remove some of the
            frames to reduce the size of the spritesheet. Here I've
            also resized the frames to measure 79px wide by 150px tall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use "File > Export Spritesheet" to output a spritesheet:
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="images/guy_walk.png">
          </p>
          <p>
            "File > Save as"
              lets you create an animated gif (only 8-bit color, 1-bit alpha here so it looks a little crappy):
